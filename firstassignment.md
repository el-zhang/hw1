A musical instrument project of any sort using Arduino: Electronic Piano Keyboard with Preset Songs

This is a electric keyboard and a song player. It has two main functions: first, it can play the voice of the "piano key" you are pressing and can play the chose preset melody as well. This is a very interesting project for it offers two different kinds of experience at the same time: control the melody totally by your single press and make your own tune and just choose and it will automatically play a piece of music. What I am curious about is whether we can have the two functions work together which means choose a preset music and make it play, then add single presses by the piano keyboard on the melody at the same time.

About sensors

Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
This must be a very useful sensor as it can be used as a variable to control the outcome. The resistance-force line is not a linear, it changes quicker in low force measurements than from infinite to 100KΩ, which is different from our thinking. One more thing I am curious about is that as the pressure is measured by the amount of Active Element dots touch the semiconductor, I am not sure what will happen if two presses with different pressure is made with the same touch surface, for example using a stick to press the resister twice with different power, as they may cause the same amout of Active Element dots to touch the semiconductor as they have the same contact area.

Thermocouple
It is better to be used for big temperature changes and can serve from from -200°C to 1350°C. The change of voltage is not linear as well, and can be hard to measure. I was thinking this sensor might be able to used in making some kitchen tools, but it seems not working cause the change of voltage is too small to be measured.

Photocells
This sensor can read the amount of light shining onto the squiggly face. And due to my experience using it in class, it seems that different pieces have different ranges which may cause problems.
