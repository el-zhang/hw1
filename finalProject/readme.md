#### Firework machine

##### Proposal
I want to make a firework machine. I will have a force sensitive resistor and an accelerometer work together, the accelerometer will control the color of the firework, and the force sensitive resistor will control the speed the firework appears. I may use my PC screen as an output.

##### Minimal Viable Project
⋅⋅⋅A working project, controled by two sensors and a firework is shown on the screen one by one.

##### Optional add-ons
⋅⋅* -Sound
⋅⋅* -Several fireworks shown together
⋅⋅* -Several fireworks work on screen together triggered real time by using another axis of the accelerometer

Include flow charts, block diagrams, and pseudo-code
